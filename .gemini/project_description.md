# js-mandelbrot Project Description

This project is a web-based application designed to visualize and interactively explore the Mandelbrot fractal. It allows users to zoom into different regions of the fractal, observe its complex patterns, and learn about fractal geometry.

## Software Stack:
The application utilizes a modern web stack for its frontend:
-   **HTML:** For structuring the web page and its elements.
-   **CSS:** For styling the user interface and visual presentation.
-   **JavaScript:** For application logic, user interaction, and initial fractal calculations.
-   **WebGPU:** For high-performance, GPU-accelerated rendering and complex computations of the Mandelbrot set. This enables smoother zooming, faster rendering of intricate details, and more efficient exploration of the fractal space.

## Key Features:
-   Interactive zooming and panning of the Mandelbrot set using GPU acceleration via WebGPU.
-   High-quality, computationally intensive fractal rendering.
-   User-friendly interface for controlling exploration and visualizing fractal details.
